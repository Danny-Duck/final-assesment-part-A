# Purpose

The Purpose of our app is to create a platform for small restaurant owners to establish an online presence.

With "final project name" the restaurant owner will be able to create a simple page with general information about their business to have a google page ranking.

Currently the skew of restaurant online representation is large and confusing. Some opt for just a google maps listing, having only opening hours, address and contact information. Others options are a facebook page, which offers less customisation, or a full fledges wix website which can be time consuming and confusing.

We aim to solve this problem of multiple identities, where businesses can collected all their information in one place, while linking already established identities, such as Instagram, UberEats and or Google Maps.
