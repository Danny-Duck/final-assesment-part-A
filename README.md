## Restaurant Owners

My name is Jimmy Hendrix, I own a small juice bar called Jacked Juice. I wish to establish an online presence but don’t have the time or money to set up a complete website. I want to create an account. Fill out information about the items on my menu, then have a site generated for my restaurant displaying opening hours and street address. I also want to have a link to my Instagram on the site.

My name is Elon Tusk, I manage a small burger chain, each shop has a different menu. I already have an account with “final project name” and want to update opening hours of a restaurant as well as add a new item to a menu.

My name is Al Capone, I help out at my parents restaurant. They have a Hawaiian lunch and Italian dinner menu as well as a drinks and happy hour menu. I want to create a menu for each and have them themed accordingly.
