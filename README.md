# User Stories

## Restaurant Owners

My name is Jimmy Hendrix, I own a small juice bar called Jacked Juice. I wish to establish an online presence but don’t have the time or money to set up a complete website. I want to create an account. Fill out information about the items on my menu, then have a site generated for my restaurant displaying opening hours and street address. I also want to have a link to my Instagram on the site.

My name is Elon Tusk, I manage a small burger chain, each shop has a different menu. I already have an account with “final project name” and want to update opening hours of a restaurant as well as add a new item to a menu.

My name is Al Capone, I help out at my parents restaurant. They have a Hawaiian lunch and Italian dinner menu as well as a drinks and happy hour menu. I want to create a menu for each and have them themed accordingly.

My name is Dandrews, I run a small food truck. I don’t have the means to set up a complete website. I want to create a “final project name” site. Where I can display the hours and locations I operate my truck at, as well as the food available.

## Customers

My name is Angela Merkel, I’ve come to a new area of my city and am craving banana cake. I want to find a bakery that makes banana bread, when they’re open and how I can contact them. After googling local bakeries I find a “final project name” site that has a menu, opening hours and a phone number. I now enjoy cake
